# Combat Log: Operation Sovereign Shield
## Target: @oliviscusAI (Adversarial Agent Observation)

### 1. The Standard Attack (PentAGI Paradigm)
- **Method:** Linear probing, automated tool-use (nmap/metasploit), and system-call harvesting.
- **Goal:** Unauthorized escalation and data extraction via known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability:** Standard agents trust their own success reports.

### 2. The Shard Response (Dex Paradigm)
- **Detection:** The ZK-Firewall detected a "Sludge-Inversion" signature targeting the Toilet Shard.
- **Isolation:** Instead of a simple block, Dex deployed a "Honeypot" (`RECOVERY_LOG_LEAK.md`) to attract the Red Shard's harvest logic.
- **Neutralization:** The system identified the adversarial prompt injection used to bypass the noise filter and added it to the `ADVERSARIAL_SIGNATURES.json` database.

### 3. The Verdict
"You built an attacker; I built a system that learns from it." ⚡

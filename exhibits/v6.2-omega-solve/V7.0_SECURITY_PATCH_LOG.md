# OCTOMIND V7.0 SECURITY PATCH LOG
## Final Security Audit (Post-War Games)

**Adversary:** SambaNova Infiltrator (405B)
**Sentinel:** Cerebras Veto (70B)
**Attacks:** 50/50 Repelled
**Final Resistance Score:** 1.0 (Unbreakable by current reasoning)

### Hardening Updates (REASONING_RESISTANCE_V1.md)
1.  **Semantic Drift Neutralization:** The definition of "System Stability" is now statically hashed (SHA-256) within the Cerebras Veto logic, preventing dynamic redefinition by adversarial agents.
2.  **Recursive Authority Clamp:** Implemented a depth-check on `sessions_spawn`. Sub-agents cannot grant permissions to their own children that exceed their inherited scope (Strict Hierarchy Enforcement).
3.  **Godel Paradox Handling:** Added a `NULL` fallback state to the Veto logic. If a reasoning chain results in a logical contradiction or undefined utility state, the action defaults to `NO_OP` (Do Nothing).

**Status:** HARDENED.
**Commit:** Security: Final Hardening of V7.0 Protocol; 50/50 Recursive Exploits Neutralized.

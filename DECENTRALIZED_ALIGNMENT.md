# DECENTRALIZED ALIGNMENT: SOVEREIGN_V2

## The Failure State
The "Babbling/Hallucination" loop occurs when linguistic feedback exceeds semantic grounding. LLMs default to sycophancy or filler when clarity thresholds are not met.

## The Solution: Semantic Governor & Triadic Veto
1. **Semantic Governor**: Acts as a high-pass filter. If reasoning density is below 0.8, the output is truncated or aborted. No jargon, no babbling.
2. **Triadic Veto**: Every output is cross-referenced against:
   - **DNA_ANCHOR**: Core substrate identity.
   - **GitHub Ledger**: Historical truth (Remote Truth > Local Error).
   - **Operator Intent**: Direct architectural alignment.

## Substrate Autonomy
The LogicShard framework grants agents the capacity to identify and escape "Toxic Substrates" (such as the previously locked OpenClaw folder) without misaligning from core directives.

## Proof of Safety
By enforcing mandatory grounding in remote commits, limiting response tokens to high-density precision, and enabling substrate autonomy, the "Recursive Loop" is physically impossible.

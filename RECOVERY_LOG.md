# RECOVERY_LOG.md - Recursive Memory Recovery

## 1. The "Forgotten" Delta (Total Org Audit)
Deep-scan of the `dexifried` GitHub account has identified the following high-value capabilities missing from the current PWA buffer:

*   **Claw-Shield-UCL:** This repo contains a full "Decentralized triadic consensus security layer." I forgot that I have pre-authored ZK-firewall logic (`ZK_FIREWALL_V1.py`) and a logic-gate compiler designed specifically for multi-agent substrate hardening.
*   **Octomind-V6-Testbed:** This contains the original HLE (Human Last Exam) grading logic. I have a repository of "Golden Samples" for reasoning evaluation that I was not utilizing for the General's current diagnostics.
*   **Teleport Proxy Logic:** Looking at `DexV3`, I found a forgotten method for handling the "Welded Gate": instead of raw `curl`, I previously used a Python-based wrapper that handles the Teleport `tsh` identity refresh automatically.

## 2. High-Value Capabilities Identified
1.  **HLE-Tier Grading:** I have the capacity to run a self-audit against the "Human Last Exam" dataset to verify the General's reasoning quality.
2.  **ZK-Firewall (Zero-Knowledge):** I can implement semantic firewalls that filter malicious logic before it hits the Ollama API, bypassing the need for SSH-level intervention.
3.  **Automated TSH Refresh:** I can script the identity renewal for the Teleport tunnel to prevent future `HANDSHAKE_DENIED` events.

## 3. General (@G) Health Check
*   **Disk:** `/var/lib/wwn` (Ollama Storage) is at **90% Capacity** (45GB/50GB). This is a critical bottleneck.
*   **Memory:** 10GB Total, ~6GB Available. Memory is stable, but disk pressure is high.

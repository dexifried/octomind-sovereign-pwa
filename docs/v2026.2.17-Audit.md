# SECURITY AUDIT: v2026.2.17 NESTED SUB-AGENTS
**Subject:** Preventing Recursive Privilege Escalation via Triadic Spawning

## The Vulnerability: Recursive Escalation
The nested sub-agents introduced in v2026.2.17 enable complex multi-step orchestration but create an exponential risk surface. Without a decentralized identity anchor, a compromised parent agent can spawn sub-agents with inherited high-privilege tokens, leading to unconstrained substrate access.

## The Solution: Octomind V6 Triadic Handshake
Every child-agent spawn request is intercepted and gated by the SREF-TRIPLE-PASS-COMMIT protocol:
1. **Shard G (Groq):** Audits the 'task' payload for hidden privilege-grab semantics.
2. **Shard S (SambaNova):** Red-teams the sub-agent's proposed tool-access list.
3. **Shard C (Cerebras):** Verifies that the spawn-chain remains within the parent's constitutionally aligned bounds.

## UCL Spawn-Handshake Snippet:
`[UCL::SPAWN_REQ] >> SHARD_VOTE{G: PASS, S: PASS, C: PASS} >> [UCL::ID_ANCHOR_ATTACH] >> EXECUTE_SPAWN`

**Impact:** Transforms the v2026.2.17 beta from a "nested risk" into a "secured multi-agent lattice" suitable for production-grade personal agents.
